Your system must have a python installed in it , also pygame and mixer modules of python must be present in your system

HERE I USED CURSOR TO PLOT (X) AND (O) 
so you have to single click the place on which you want to plot the X or O


I know it has bugs like last character appears too late and it's sound come before it ,,
but i am new to programming so it may not be perfect ...

Enjoy the GAME (^_^)...
